TRICK: 
    if a reposetory was deleted on Githab, and stil local. the best way to push this repo is:
        - at the first we add this comand: (rm -rf .git )=> This delete the settig to the old repo from the .git folder
        - then (create new repo on github and push normaly the code to the new repo)
